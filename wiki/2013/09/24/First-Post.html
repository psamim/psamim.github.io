			<p>This is a personal wiki for me. Everyday I come across new tips, tricks, technics, websites or other interesting things which I want to have a place for them all. So I started this personal wiki.</p>

<p>I put it online so it would be accessible for me anywhere I am, and maybe I want to send public links to my friends.</p>

<p>To put it as simple as possible, I wanted all the notes to be in plain text and searchable with simple tools like <strong>grep</strong> or <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/"><strong>ack</strong></a>, to avoid the complexity of databases and servers or putting the notes deep inside the database and making it inaccesible for everyday use, I chose to write my notes in <strong>yaml</strong> format and publish them by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>jekyll</strong></a>. Jekkyl parses yaml documents into JSON, then interactiviy and search is added by AngularJS framewrok. Therefore, all the website is static, posts are retrieved by GET method and the whole application runs inside browser.</p>
