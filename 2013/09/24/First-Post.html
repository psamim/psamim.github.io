			<p>This is a personal wiki for me. Everyday I come across new tips, tricks, technics, websites or other interesting things which I want to have a place for them all. So I started this personal wiki.</p>

<p>I put it online so it would be accessible for me anywhere I am, and maybe I want to send public links to my friends.</p>

<p>To put it as simple as possible, I wanted all the notes to be in plain text and searchable with simple tools like <strong>grep</strong> or <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/"><strong>ack</strong></a>, to avoid the complexity of databases and servers or putting the notes deep inside the database and making it in accesible for everyday use. So I chose to write my notes in <strong>yaml</strong> format and publish them by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>jekyll</strong></a>.</p>
